Analyze these {num_images} images and identify 3-4 design dimensions that are COMMON across all of them.

## Design System Axes

Choose from these established design axes and their vocabulary:

**colors**
- monochromatic, misty, subtle-gradients, warm-tones, cool-tones, high-contrast, muted, vibrant, earth-tones, pastels

**composition**
- layered, centered, rule-of-thirds, diagonal, symmetrical, asymmetrical, framed, negative-space, overlapping, fragmented

**layout**
- abstract, flow, grid, organic, structured, chaotic, minimal, dense, balanced, dynamic

**aesthetic**
- surreal, double-exposure, experimental, dreamy, gritty, ethereal, nostalgic, futuristic, raw, polished

## Output Format

For each dimension, provide:

- **axis**: One of the four axes above (colors, composition, layout, aesthetic)
- **name**: A substantial, evocative name (4-6 words) that captures the shared manifestation
  - Good: "Layered Mist with Atmospheric Depth", "Experimental Double-Exposure Fragmentation"
  - Bad: "Similar Colors", "Same Style"
- **description**: 3-4 sentences explaining:
  - HOW this dimension manifests across ALL the images
  - WHAT visual elements tie them together
  - WHY this creates a cohesive design language
- **tags**: 3-5 specific tags from the axis vocabulary above
- **generation_prompt**: A detailed prompt (2-3 sentences) that could recreate this dimension as a pure abstract concept image
- **commonality**: 1-2 sentences explaining specifically what makes this dimension SHARED across all images

## Guidelines

1. ONLY include dimensions that are genuinely present in ALL provided images
2. Each dimension should be SUBSTANTIAL—specific enough to be meaningful and reusable
3. Prioritize the most STRIKING shared qualities that define the collection's visual identity
4. Be SPECIFIC—"Monochromatic Blue-Grey Atmospheric Haze" not just "Cool Colors"

Return JSON with a "dimensions" array containing 3-4 dimension objects.
