Generate a pure abstract concept image that extracts and amplifies the following design dimension from the attached source image:

Dimension: {dimension_name}
Axis: {axis}
Description: {description}

Visual direction:
{generation_prompt}

Study the attached source image carefully. Your task is to create an ABSTRACT concept image that:
1. Distills the "{dimension_name}" quality from the source into a pure visual essence
2. Amplifies and isolates this specific design dimension
3. Is abstract, textural, or pattern-based - NOT a recreation of the source
4. Could serve as a mood board or design reference for this quality
5. Strongly communicates the aesthetic feeling without depicting recognizable objects

The concept image should capture WHAT makes the source image embody "{dimension_name}" - its colors, textures, rhythms, and visual energy - in abstract form.
