Design tag guidelines (select 1-3 per axis based on the scene):
NOTE: These are SUGGESTED tags. You may use novel, specific tags when they better describe the scene.
For example, "film-noir" for style, "golden-hour" for colors, or "dutch-angle" for composition are valid.
The system learns from your tags, so be precise and descriptive.
