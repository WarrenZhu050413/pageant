Analyze this image and extract a reusable design token (prompt fragment).

{user_context}

TASK: Based on the image and what the user appreciates about it, create a condensed prompt fragment
that captures the essence of the visual style, mood, or technique. This fragment will be used to
guide future image generation.

RULES:
1. The 'name' should be short and evocative (2-4 words), like "Golden Hour Warmth" or "Moody Noir"
2. The 'text' should be a 1-2 sentence prompt fragment describing the visual qualities
3. Include 3-6 'style_tags' for categorization and searchability
4. Set 'category' to one of: lighting, mood, composition, color, texture, or mixed

Focus on extracting the specific visual qualities the user seems to appreciate based on their
annotation and liked tags. If no explicit preferences are given, analyze the image's most
distinctive and reusable visual characteristics.
