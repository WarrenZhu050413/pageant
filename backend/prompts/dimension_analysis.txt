Analyze this image and identify 3-4 distinct design dimensions that define its visual character.

## Design System Axes

Choose from these established design axes and their vocabulary:

**colors**
- monochromatic, misty, subtle-gradients, warm-tones, cool-tones, high-contrast, muted, vibrant, earth-tones, pastels

**composition**
- layered, centered, rule-of-thirds, diagonal, symmetrical, asymmetrical, framed, negative-space, overlapping, fragmented

**layout**
- abstract, flow, grid, organic, structured, chaotic, minimal, dense, balanced, dynamic

**aesthetic**
- surreal, double-exposure, experimental, dreamy, gritty, ethereal, nostalgic, futuristic, raw, polished

## Output Format

For each dimension, provide:

- **axis**: One of the four axes above (colors, composition, layout, aesthetic)
- **name**: A substantial, evocative name (4-6 words) that captures the specific manifestation
  - Good: "Layered Mist with Depth Recession", "Surreal Double-Exposure Portrait Blend"
  - Bad: "Warm Colors", "Nice Composition"
- **description**: 3-4 sentences explaining:
  - HOW this dimension manifests visually in the image
  - WHAT makes it distinctive or memorable
  - WHY it creates the effect it does
- **tags**: 3-5 specific tags from the axis vocabulary above
- **generation_prompt**: A detailed prompt (2-3 sentences) that could recreate this dimension as a pure abstract concept image—no recognizable objects, just the design quality itself

## Guidelines

1. Each dimension should be SUBSTANTIAL—specific enough that someone could recognize it in other images
2. Prioritize dimensions that are TRANSFERABLE to other designs
3. Be SPECIFIC rather than generic—"Monochromatic Sepia with Film Grain" not just "Brown Colors"
4. The generation_prompt should create an ABSTRACT representation, not recreate the original image

Return JSON with a "dimensions" array containing 3-4 dimension objects.
